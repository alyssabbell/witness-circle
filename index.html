      <h3 id="about">About</h3>
      <p>
        I have been active with faith-based ceremony work for over ten years. In 2003 I completed MLA’s Leadership Training Program in Sapphire Canyon, Colorado, and have served several times as a Guide with The Berkshire Men’s Circle. I have gone on to study Rites Of Passage work such as participating in Vision Fast ceremonies with the School of Lost Borders in Big Pine, California, and serving on staff with the Men’s Leadership Alliance in Eldora, Colorado. I am also a registered officiant with the State of New York, and a trained Life and Career Coach. I will work with you to craft a ceremony that speaks to your faith, focusing the words of your ceremony towards the intention of your commitment. Deeply rooted in community, passion, and spirit, I offer an inclusive and joyful presence for your wedding celebration!</p>

      <p>Ceremonies</p>
      <p>We gather in ceremony to mark and declare what is already true in your relationships and to have this declaration witnessed by your community. These are the people who have loved you into being, and now you share this next passage in your life. Clearly stating your intent and inviting us all to support you in it creates a ceremony that will resonate for you and your invited guests. Together, we will mark your intention.</p>

      <p>Individual Coaching</p>
      <p>You’re caught in traffic or sitting at your desk, looking out at the sunshine. Or, perhaps you’re reading an inspiring book. You hear that voice, small yet insistent. <i>Where is the life of my dreams? How can I be excited about my life again? </i></p>
      <p>My coaching uses a one-on-one dynamic as the foundation of the work we will do together to get to the heart of breakthroughs in your human experience. No one can reach that breakthrough alone. Coaching provides a nurturing space that invites you to peel back the layers of your past and present and investigate the heart and soul of your questioning. </p>
      <p>Coaching is a conversation that turns your desires into action plans toward your future. Our sessions combine the philosophical and pragmatic elements inherent in any life shift, building a strong foundation to hold what arises as you take your first steps down new paths. </p>

      <h3 id="q-a">Q&A</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Q: Does it matter which denomination of faith I practice?</li>
        <li>A: We can create a ceremony as religious, spiritual, or secular as you wish. In the past I’ve incorporated elements from Korean, Jewish, Catholic, and Palestinian traditions, among others. From the setup of the chairs to the structure of readings and vows, I will work with you to create a ceremony whose every element reflects you and your partner. The heart of the process is an inclusive, pan-cultural tradition that honors and welcomes all the ways of blessing marriage and each other.</li>


        <li>Q: We already had a civil ceremony, and now want to share our commitment with our friends and family. Can you work with us?</li>

        <li>A: Yes! In the event you’ve already been to a City Hall, or live in a state where our work is not a legal ceremony, the process becomes that much more resonant, reaching through convention and expectations to bring your family and friends close to share your commitment to a life together!</li>


        <li>Q: Are you able to accommodate destination weddings?</li>
        <li>A: Yes, I currently work with a destination wedding company, and also work privately. Prices are distinct for destination weddings, and I network with a team of wonderful professionals to provide every element for your getaway wedding!</li>

        <li>Q: What other kinds of ceremonies do you create?</li>

        <li>A: Weddings are a beautiful chance to mark one of life’s great thresholds, but too many of life’s moments slip by without appreciating and marking them in ceremony. Bought a new house? Let’s create a wonderful house blessing to start fresh in your new home. Is there a new little one in the family? Let’s welcome them with a personal, joyful baby blessing! From the passing of elders to a shift in jobs, our lives are filled with significant opportunities to give thanks for what has been, welcome what is present, and move ahead with hope, support, and joy!</li>

        <li>Q: Are you a registered officiant?</li>
        <li>A: I am a legally-registered officiant, authorized and recognized by the State of New York.</li>


        <li>Q: We already had a civil ceremony, and now want to share our commitment with our friends and family. Can you work with us?</li>

        <li>Q: I’m looking for someone that will get to know me and my partner. What’s the process?</li>
        <li>A: Sitting together, you’ll access a deep connection with your wedding, and your marriage. I’ve worked with couples from three weeks to nine months before their ceremony. We have a dialogue about what your wedding is marking, what’s already true in your relationship, and the most resonant way to embody that in a wedding ceremony that’s personal, memorable, and fun!</li>


        <li>Q: How do we get started?</li>
        <li>A: For an initial call or in-person meeting with Jonathan, e-mail jonathan@witnesscircle.com, or call (518) 290-0740.</li>
